# 📊 India's Population Distribution Visualization

This project is part of **SkillCraft Technology's Task 01**, which focuses on visualizing categorical or continuous variables. In this task, we analyze and visualize the **age-wise distribution of India’s population in 2022** using bar charts and histograms.

## 🔍 Project Objective

To create effective visualizations (bar chart or histogram) to represent how a population is distributed based on age groups or genders. This helps in understanding demographic patterns and potential socio-economic implications.
